# Facial Recognition System: Performance & Evaluation Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document details the performance and evaluation metrics, face quality assessment, and recognition logic used in the facial recognition system. It is intended for technical evaluation, research, or reporting purposes.

## 2. Face Quality Assessment

### Metrics Used

- **Sharpness:**
  - Measured as the variance of the Laplacian of the grayscale face image.
  - Indicates how in-focus the face is (higher = sharper).
  - Threshold: > 80 (empirically chosen).
- **Brightness:**
  - Mean pixel intensity of the grayscale face image.
  - Ensures the face is neither too dark nor too bright.
  - Threshold: 80 < brightness < 200.
- **Face Size:**
  - Percentage of the frame area occupied by the detected face.
  - Ensures the face is large enough for reliable encoding.
  - Threshold: > 5% of the frame area.
- **Overall Face Quality Score:**
  - Calculated as the percentage of metrics that pass their thresholds.
  - 100%: All metrics good (green overlay).
  - 67%: Two out of three metrics good (orange overlay).
  - <67%: One or zero metrics good (red overlay).
  - Registration is only allowed if the score is at least 67%.

## 3. Recognition Logic

### Encoding and Storage

- Each registered face is encoded as a 128-dimensional vector using the `face_recognition` library.
- Encodings are stored in a persistent JSON file (`data/face_encodings.json`) as a mapping from user ID to encoding.

### Matching Algorithm

- For each detected face, the system computes its encoding and compares it to all stored encodings using Euclidean distance.
- **Best Match Distance:**
  - The smallest distance between the detected face encoding and any stored encoding.
  - Lower values indicate higher similarity.
- **Threshold for Match:**
  - Default: 0.65 (can be tuned).
  - If the best match distance is below the threshold, the face is considered a match.
- **Recognition Output:**
  - If a match is found, the corresponding user ID is displayed.
  - If no match is found, “No Match” is displayed.

## 4. Performance Metrics

### Frame Processing Time

- The time taken to process each video frame (in milliseconds).
- Includes face detection, encoding, and matching.
- Displayed as an overlay on the video feed.

### Frames Per Second (FPS)

- The number of frames processed per second.
- Calculated as the running average over the session.
- Displayed as an overlay on the video feed.

### Interpretation

- **Higher FPS** indicates better real-time performance.
- **Lower frame time** (ms) means faster processing per frame.
- Performance may vary based on hardware, image resolution, and number of registered faces.

## 5. Evaluation Methodology

### Face Registration

- Only faces with sufficient quality (as per the metrics above) are allowed to be registered.
- Duplicate faces are detected by comparing encodings; only higher-quality registrations can overwrite existing ones.

### Recognition Evaluation

- Recognition is evaluated by presenting registered and unregistered faces to the system.
- The system’s output (match/no match, user ID, confidence) is compared to ground truth.

### Simulated Backend Integration

- When a face is recognized for a set number of consecutive frames, a simulated backend check-in is triggered.
- The payload and simulated backend response are displayed for evaluation and debugging.
